====================
WoW Script Builder
====================

WoW Script Builder is a program to make the scripting of zones, dungeons and possibly other things easier. It is made for World of Warcraft Private Servers and it's focus lies on C++.
It is written in Visual Basic 2008 (3.5 .NET Framework) and is the first real project I ever started.

You can find the "Website" (Blog, actually) here: http://dalekjace.wordpress.com this will contain the updates if you just want to follow the project, instead of all the coding and such.

The Project is far from finished. It's not even in Alpha yet. It will enter Alpha when I get the basic framework to work correctly. Feel free to grab a copy, but it won't satisfy you at all right now, as it's filled with broken, wrong and futile code.
